    <title>About My Scoring</title>
    My scores are not solely based on enjoyment, but rather on my overall satisfaction. I seek out well-written and high-quality shows that also give audiences enjoyment. I prefer character-driven shows to plot-driven ones. I love experiencing beautiful visuals and soundtracks, as well as the depth of characters.

    <title>My Scoring Criteria</title>
    
    [spoiler="My Scoring Criteria"]
    🏆 [b][[10]] Masterpiece[/b] - A true masterpiece, almost flawless, outstanding, and perfectly composed. I consider anime at this score to be something very special to me. These anime leave a strong and everlasting impression.

    🥇 [b][[9]] Excellent[/b] - An ideal anime, undeniably great and surprisingly well-composed. These shows excel in almost every way, exceeding way beyond my expectations. I consider anime at this score to be one of my favorites. These anime sure leave an impression.

    🥈 [b][[8]] Great[/b] - A great anime, solid and well-rounded experience. These shows executed their main selling points to their fullest, giving audiences a very enjoyable watching experience.

    🥉 [b][[7]] Good[/b] - A standard anime, having everything an anime should have. There may be a few flaws, but the main selling points are still intact and getting executed well, resulting in an enjoyable watching experience.

    🙆‍♂️ [b][[6]] Fine[/b] - An ordinary anime, having good aspects slightly outweigh the bad. These shows have their own main selling points, but they are either not strong or executed to their full potential. After all, it is still overall a worthwhile watching experience.

    🤷‍♂️ [b][[5]] Passable[/b] - An acceptable anime, being neither good nor bad. These shows are having a selling point, a potential, but are wasted. They could have been much better with more proper production, still, they are giving a minimal amount of joy.

    🙅‍♂️ [b][[4]] Poor[/b] - A failed anime. These shows are either having bad aspects overweighing good ones, or simply just lacking selling points. A badly-written or rushed ending can also earn this score. They are not entirely bad, but rather disappointing.

    🤦‍♂️ [b][[3]] Bad[/b] - A bad anime. These shows contain obvious or serious issues. Amateur writing, story blandness, messy storytelling, empty-shell characters, or insanely boring watching experience can also earn this score. There may be some worthwhile moments but still are overshadowed by the issues. 

    💀 [b][[2]] Problematic[/b] - An anime itself is the issue, being surprisingly low in quality. These shows are either considered bad in almost every aspect to the point where it is far beyond fixing, or the writing is almost an insult to the audiences, or at least to me.

    💩 [b][[1]] Horrifying[/b] - Something horrifying, insulting, or offensively bad. I regret watching these shows to the point where i resent and want to unsee them.

    <title>Other Notes</title>
    ✎ My lists are mainly organized by tags, so I recommend using them, viewing my lists will be much easier.
    ✎ In a simpler term, a score of [b][5][/b] means neutral, [b][6][/b] or above is positive, and [b][4][/b] or below is negative.
    ✎ Specials are scored by the watching value and time worthiness, having a score of [b][5][/b] being most neutral.
    ✎ Music videos are scored on my [profile=810Teams_EX]alternate account[/profile] to prevent scores mixing up.
    ✎ Music videos are scored by my music preferences and the animation quality combined.
