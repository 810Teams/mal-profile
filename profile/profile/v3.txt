　　<title>My Scoring Criteria</title>
　　　Scores are mainly based on enjoyment, impression, emotional impact, and memorability, resulting from various
　　　elements of the anime, including story, storytelling, logic, uniqueness, animation ǫuality, eye-friendliness,
　　　theme songs, insert songs, soundtracks, mood and tone, voice acting, character design, character personality,
　　　character development, character story, and character purpose.
