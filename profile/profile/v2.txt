　　<title>My Scoring Criteria</title>
　　　Scores are mainly based on enjoyment, impression, emotional impact, and memorability, resulting from various
　　　elements of the anime, including story, storytelling, logic, uniqueness, animation ǫuality, eye-friendliness,
　　　theme songs, insert songs, soundtracks, mood and tone, voice acting, character design, character personality,
　　　character development, character story, and character purpose.

　　<title>About My Scoring</title>
　　　◆ In a simpler term, a score of [b]<score_5>[/b] means neutral, [b]<score_6>[/b] or above means positive, and [b]<score_4>[/b] or below means negative.
　　　◆ Scoring does not apply to dropped series, ads, or previews.
　　　◆ Scores may change due to having more comparison overtime.
　　　◆ Scoring on music videos is calculated by my music preference and the animation quality.

　　<title>About My Reviews</title>
　　　◆ My reviews concepts are polite, structured, and not too long.
　　　◆ My reviews are anime-based, no manga comparison.
　　　◆ My reviews appreciate with love, criticize with hope for improvements, not with hate.
